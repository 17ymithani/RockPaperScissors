# Rock Paper Scissors Game

*You will need Node.js and git installed.*
To check run the commands:
`node -v`
`git -v`

## Setting up

1. Create an account on GitHub: https://github.com/
2. Fork the repository: https://github.com/humairaasaleh/RockPaperScissors.git ensuring the Owner is set to your account, and the `Copy the main branch only` tickbox is selected. 
3. In the `Code` tab of the repository, select the green `<> Code` dropdown and copy the HTTPS link.
4. On your laptops, create a new empty folder, titling the folder with your names. 
5. Open up VSCode, go to `File` and `Open Folder` and locate the folder you have just created and open that.
6. In VSCode, open up a New Terminal (run the command `pwd` to make sure you are located in your new folder)
7. Enter the command: git clone `paste the HTTPS link from step 3 here` . This should have cloned the github repository to your new folder.
8. Run the command `npm start` which will open up the app in the browser. 

## Activity 1:

Your first task will be to create a multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game. It can be as simple or complex as you would like it to be (depending on your coding experience). 

The main functionality to start off with is being able to take in 2 user inputs for their moves, and calculate the winner and output it to the screen. 

Extra things you can add:
* Inputs for player names
* Outputting what each player selected
* Images for the Rock/Paper/Scissors 

## Activty 2:

Have some fun and get creative by developing the Welcome Page for the app. Play around with the different react-bootstrap components. I'd reccommend planning out how you want the page to look by creating a wireframe (template of the page). This is commonly done in the working world when developing. 

Useful links to create a wireframe on:
* https://wireframe.cc/

## Extension: 

This is a stretch task which will be quite challenging, but is something to take home to work on. Create a leaderboard which stores the winners/scores from each game played.

## Developers Guide

* In the browser of the app: right click, select `Inspect`, then naviaget to the `Console` tab. This is where you will see any errors or if you log anything to the console.
* Remember, if you are stuck Google is your best friend.
